# A-Space-Game
This repository contains my first Commodore 64 game in assembly... I've learned and implemented basic aspects that forms the foundation of a game, 
and though it is a playable game, it is not meant to last hours of joy. Bitmap picture, smooth text scrolling, control of sprites, high score, music
(by Richard Bayliss) & sound effects etc have been included in the code... Feel free to use it by any means.
Thanks.
